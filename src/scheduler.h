// - Added ability to run tasks in serial, bypassing the thread pool
//   - Using num_threads == 0 doesn't create any workers, and all tasks run in serial immediately by the calling thread
//   - k_all is now defined as -1
// - Added Scheduler::singleton() which returns a global instance of a Scheduler. Upon first being called, the scheduler
//   is created and started with num_threads = k_all. The function is guarded by a mutex.
// - Tasks now store an exception which is re-thrown in TaskTracker::wait()
// - Added ready() function to TaskTracker
// - Added various wrapper/utility templates (parallel_for, blocked_range, do_async) which provide a simpler,
//   higher-level API and allow creating tasks with lambdas containing captures.
// - Fixed a few type inconsistencies (mixing uint32_t with int)
// - Fixed minor spelling mistakes
// - Converted to snake_casing, and added some more comments.

/**
    Implementation of a simple but versatile task scheduler. The scheduler allows to parallelize
    workload and gives full control over how many threads to burst compute to. Nested parallelism
    is fully supported, with priority to inner parallelism. Compared to a typical work stealing
    implementation, there is no spinning, and when there is not enough workload, some threads
    will go idle instead of spinning, making it obvious when the CPU runs underutilized.
    Launching a task incurs a small memory allocation of 48 bytes for the task itself, that
    is it. Lambda captures are not allowed to contain the overhead and the system implementation
    nimble. The scheduler can be instantiated multiple times, to create multiple isolated thread
    pools or \ref singleton() returns a pointer to a global singleton (constructed on first
    use). Schedulers can be instantiated on demand and destroyed if needed.
    Use \ref start() and \ref stop() methods to initialize and teardown a scheduler.
    For examples, look at the documentation of the \ref parallelize() and \ref parallelize_async() methods.

    /**
        Parallelize a task over a number of threads and make the caller participate in the
        computation.

        The call only returns on task completion. If the task implementation will
        make any nested calls to execute parallel workload, the task will wait on completion of
        any related nested task. On completion, the task scheduler can executed an optional
        epilogue function where you can wrap up the computation, for example to sum the thread
        partials of a parallel reduction.
        The scheduler doesn't make any assumption on the workload complexity or its uniformity.
        It is up to you to partition the workload in reasonable units of work, or to use the
        WorkloadController utility to load balance between threads.

        \param num_threads defines how many threads you would like to wake up to execute the
               parallel workload. Each of the threads will execute a "unit" of work whose index
               will be between 0 and num_threads-1. Different from a "parellel_for", you don't
               specify how many elements to iterate over, or expect the scheduler to guess how
               many threads it is appropriate to partition the work. It sounds more laborious
               but it gives more control over the execution.
        \param data a generic pointer over the task data, see example.
        \param fn the task function in the format void (*TaskFn)(int unit_index, int thread_index,
               void* data).
        \param epilogue optional ask wrap-up function, executed when all the unit of works are
               completed. The type is the same as the task function except that the first arg
               is "int num_units" instead of the unit_index.

        \code{.cpp}

        however some attention must be taken to make sure the task data persists for the duration
        of the task. Typically, you want to wait on the task completion, in which case the use of
        stack memory for the task data is all you need. Otherwise, allocate any task data on the
        heap and use the epilogue function to free it. If you run \ref parallelize_async() from within
        another task, make sure you call \ref wait() in the TaskTracker, unless the completion of the
